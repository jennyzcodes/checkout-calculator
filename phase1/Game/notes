Code Affected: IMain.java, MainPresenter.java, MainActivity.java
Changes: 1) Renamed interface: IMain -> ILogin, IMainView - ILoginView, IMainPresenter - ILoginPresenter
2) Renamed MainPresenter -> LoginPresenter
3) Made MainActivity implement ILoginView, and implemented interface abstract methods
4) Removed methods getUsername() and getPassword() in ILoginView, instead directly pass username
and password into the instance methods, validateLogin() and validateSignUp of the LoginPresenter object,
which replace the LoginBtnClicked() and SignUpBtnClicked() methods.
5) In LoginPresenter, in the .validateLogin(), if login is successful, should navigate to course
selector activity. Changes made to accommodate.
