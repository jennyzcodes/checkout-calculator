Code Affected: EVERYTHING
Initial commit & Push
#########
Step 2 (Grace)
Code Affected: EVERYTHING
Added some missing files, fixed package and import at the top of each file
#########
Step 3 (Grace)
Code Affected: DataLoader.java DataSaver.java Student.java
Flaw: interfaces don't match (because class designs have been changed)
Fix: changed some methods to public, fixed some mismatching signatures etc & Added notes.txt

#########
Step 4 (Jenny)
Code Affected: none
Changes: Added 5 new activities - Activity Classes added to com.example.game/View folder and

Updated AndroidManifest.xml to reflect additional activities.

#########
Step 5 (Parinita)
Code Affected: Presenter Package
Changes: Added com.example.game ahead all of imports. There are still some errors but the imports are
fixed.

#########
Step 6 (Grace)
Code Affected: DataLoader.java DataSaver.java StGeorge.java Student.java
Changes: Changed the signature of Student constructor (the one for 1st time users). Student no longer
keeps track of a Campus object, instead it store a campusNumber.

#########
Step 7 (Grace)
Code Affected: DataSaver, the GameLevels, Campus, CustomizationManager, GameLevel, GameManager,
StGeorge, Student
Changes: fixed some more package / import problems. Modified Campus class and subclass. Campus
no longer has methods to play level, no longer stores currentLevel. Commented out add level etc.

#########
Step 8 (Grace)
Code Affected: IMain, ICustomization, CustomizationPresenter, MainPresenter, MainActivity,
CustomizationActivity, CustomizationManager, GameManager
Changes: Made MainActivity implement IMain.IMainView, CustomizationActivity implement
ICustomization.ICustomizationView. The @ Override methods are created, but not yet implemented.

#########
Step 9 (Grace)
Code Affected: MVP contracts, presenters, MainActivity, CustomizationActivity, GameLevel, Student
Changes: slightly modified the MVP contract, added comments, modified access modifiers. Temporarily
bypassed Campus class and StGeorge class. The necessity of these classes will be further discussed.

#########
Step 10 (Koby)
Code Affected: GameLevel.progressResult()
Changes: Deleted the method because it is not necessary

########
Step 11 (Jenny)
Code Affected: IMain.java, MainPresenter.java, MainActivity.java
Changes: 1) Renamed interface: IMain -> ILogin, IMainView - ILoginView, IMainPresenter - ILoginPresenter
2) Renamed MainPresenter -> LoginPresenter
3) Made MainActivity implement ILoginView, and implemented interface abstract methods
4) Removed methods getUsername() and getPassword() in ILoginView, instead directly pass username
and password into the instance methods, validateLogin() and validateSignUp of the LoginPresenter object,
which replace the LoginBtnClicked() and SignUpBtnClicked() methods.
5) In LoginPresenter, in the .validateLogin(), if login is successful, should navigate to course
selector activity. Changes made to accommodate.

#######
Step 12 (Trisha)
Created Lvl3StartActivity, Lvl3GameActivity, Lvl3GameView and MainThread in Model.Level3 folder.
Added layout activity_main_lvl_3 for the start page of the game.
These are the two activities required for running the main menu of the level 3 game and the game
view, respectively. Lvl3GameView creates the surface view for the game. MainThread class is
responsible for the game loop.

#########
Step 13 (Grace)
Code Affected: IData, ICustomization, ILogin, DataHandler, GameManager, Student, StudentManager,
CustomizationPresenter, LoginPresenter, CustomizationActivity, MainActivity
Changes: added IData interface. Now only View has access to DataHandler, others need to use the IData
interface to access them. Changed the way information is passed between activities. Now instead of
passing IGameManager, we pass the current student's username, and construct a new GameManager. (Save
before leaving the page.)

#########
Step 14 (Grace)
Code Affected: ICourseSelector, CourseSelectorPresenter
Changes: added interface ICourseSelector. Implemented CourseSelectorPresenter. Added another constructor
in GameManager, changed statements where GameManager is created in presenters accordingly.

Step 17 (Koby)
Code Affected: GameLevel.java
Changes: Modify the methods in GameLevel.java, delete unnecessary methods, kept only play() (i.e: there's only
one play mehthod in the game level class.

#########

(2) Add red ball, blue ball, yellow ball drawable png file into the folder
(3) Add xml file of Lvl2_main

#########
Step 20 (Koby)
Code Affected: Level2Presenter.java
Changes: (1) Implement abstract methods from Ilevel2.Ilevel2Presenter
(2) Add getters to obtain data from the game
(3) Add setters so that there will be an update of position in the frontend view
